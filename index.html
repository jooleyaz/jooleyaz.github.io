            Hey there, my name's Julia! Welcome to my website, where I've uploaded all my projects and
            some of my hobbies and interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some things left to do to polish this site: <br>
            - align photos and text to center and figure out how spacing works on html and css <br>
            - pick my own text font, size, color, etc. <br>
            - create sub-pages including projects, experience, hobbies/interests, etc. <br>
            - add interactive elements using javascript!
        </p>
